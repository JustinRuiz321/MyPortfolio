                <p>
                    I would like to begin by saying nice to meet you! My name is Justin Ruiz. I'm a 24 year old male who uses the pronouns he/him. 
                    I currently reside in Garfield, NJ, which is located in Bergen County. I also graduated from Garfield High School while playing 
                    multiple sports during my time there. These sports taught me a lot about the importance of leadership, resilience, and teamwork at a young age. 
                    Growing up, I had a love for technology and found out abiut a great oppurtunity to learn coding by taking a certification course through 
                    Rutgers University. I aim to become an elite developer and give my all to a company willing to take the chance on me!

                <h2>Previous Work Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>IT Technician: EquityZen</li>
                        <p>
                            I begun my journey at EquityZen in March of 2022 and still currently work here. This is a great oppurtunity 
                            because I am the first IT technician hired for the company. Meaning, I had to put a lot of plans and processes in place 
                            for the future of the IT position including knowledge base articles, on-boards and off-boards processes, and my biggest 
                            accomplishment, getting rid of the outsourced IT company they were using previously. I say this is my biggest accomplishment 
                            because now they put their full trust in me being able to provide timely assistance and providing exceptional service.

                        <li>Genius: Apple Retail</li>
                        <p>
                            I worked at Apple Retail as a Genius from September of 2018, up until March of 2022. The role of a Genius is to provide troubleshooting 
                            solutions to those customers who have issues with any of their Apple products. Being a Genius, you are the only one in the store that is certified 
                            to provide troubleshooting solutions or even hardware repairs on Mac products. Another big responsibility of being a Genius, 
                            is being a leader to your peers. You are the main resource when your peers don't know the answer to a question. Not only that, but you are relied on to get 
                            everyone on the same page and make sure the team is all in when it comes to driving priorities.

                        <li>Operations Lead: 24 Hour Fitness</li>
                        <p>
                            I was an Operations Lead at 24 Hour Fitness from February of 2017, to September of 2018. Most of my repsonsibilities consisted of me making sure the gym 
                            was clean, we were stocked on the right products, scheduling, and depositing the cash that was earned throughout the weeks. This job taught me a lot of responsibilties 
                            of being a leader at a young age. At the time I was 19 years of age with the responsibilities of a management level job.
